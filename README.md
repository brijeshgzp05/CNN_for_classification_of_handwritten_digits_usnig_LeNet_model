This is a model based on LeNet model to classify hand written images.
The model has been trained on 370000 images with a test size of 20%.
It takes about 122 seconds for one epoch. 

The dataset contains 26 folders (A-Z) containing handwritten images in size 28 by 28 pixels, each alphabet in the image is centre fitted to 20 by 20 pixel box.

Each image is stored as Gray-level

Accuracy after one epoch - 91%
Accuracy after 20 epochs - 98%

Accuracy can be increased by hyperparameter tuning or by using AlexNet or VGG-16.
